<h2>Comments</h2>
<%# This will now render the partial in app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb once for each comment that is in the @article.comments collection.
    As the render method iterates over the @article.comments collection, it assigns each comment to a local variable named the same as the partial, 
    in this case comment, which is then available in the partial for us to show. %>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<%= render @article.comments %>

<h2>Add a comment:</h2>
<%= render 'comments/form' %>


<%# The second render just defines the partial template we want to render, comments/form. 
    Rails is smart enough to spot the forward slash in that string and realize that you want to 
    render the _form.html.erb file in the app/views/comments directory.

    The @article object is available to any partials rendered in the view because we defined it as an instance variable. %>
